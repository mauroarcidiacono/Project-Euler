    "The issue with the previous line of code is that the computational cost is high because the for loop evaluates the if conditions for each number. As an example, I tested the code with 1000000000 (one billion) and my computer printed the answer in 1m 20.5s. I will try to optimize the solution to reduce that time. Additionally, I would like to create a more general solution that will be able to take more than one number and that will be able to provide the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below each input.\n",

    "If I want to sum all the integers from 1 to a 100, I could simply take the tedious task of adding one number after the other. There is a tale that says that Carl Friedrich Gauss solved this problem when he was in primary school. The strategy to simplify the task is to observe the following:\n",
