    "First, I will define what a prime number is. Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided without remainder by 1 and themselves. By the modern definition, prime numbers must be divided by at least two numbers. The sequence of the first 10 primes numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer can be expressed as a product of an unique set of integers. Therefore, the process to identify the largest prime factor of a number is to factorize it and the last factor will be the number I am looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start, I will divide the desired number (n) as much as I can by 2 and replace n by the result of each division if possible. Then, I will iterate through the uneven numbers up to the square root of n as per the algorithm of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. In each cycle, if possible, I will replace n by the result of the division as well. If n equals to 1, the maximum prime will be the last divider. If n is not 1, n is a prime number.  "
